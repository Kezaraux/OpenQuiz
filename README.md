# OpenQuiz

This is a project that myself and 2 other students worked on during a highschool co-op at Opentext.

The current version in this repository can work if you clone, however it requires mongodb and node to be installed.
Just run a mongodb server on the default ip (27017), then run the node server. Most functionality of the website will not work, 
however you are still able to view the individual pages and get a general idea of how this project might have looked when it worked.

The reason it doesn't work as this project hasn't been updated in about 4 years, and the current mongodb version is far different than 
what was used to develop this project. Getting this project to a functional level would require a rewrite of the server, which will not be
 happening for quite a while (if at all).
